    <h3><center>The SHC Mens Varsity soccer team completed yet another memrable season during the 2017-18 school year. The seniors, including Joe, Sora, and Parker, demonstrated incredible leadership and acted as role models for the younger players. The team commenced the season well with a series of successful games, but towards the second half of their regular season schedule they experienced some problems, caused mainly by injuries. However, the team rebounded from their dry spell and had an incredible run in the CCS D2 playoffs. And, after a series of close games, they managed to take home the title!"</center>
